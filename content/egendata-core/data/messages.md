title: Messages

All communication between the different Egendata parties is performed through signed messages shaped as JWT:s.

## Egendata message/schema definitions

All message schemas are defined in and validated through [./lib/schemas.js](https://github.com/egendata/messaging/blob/master/lib/schemas.js) in the `@egendata/messaging` npm package.
