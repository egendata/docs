title: Messages
---

All communication between the different Egendata parties is performed through signed messages shaped as JWT:s.

## Egendata message/schema definitions

All message schemas are defined in and validated through [./lib/schemas.js](https://github.com/egendata/messaging/blob/master/lib/schemas.js) in the `@egendata/messaging` npm package.

### Values present in all messages

_Some values are present in all messages, their value will only be specified where it deviates from the default. These are defined as reserved claims in the JWT spec._

#### JWT_DEFAULTS

iss | The issuer of the message. Example: `https://myservice.org`
aud | The intended audience of the message. Example: `https://operator.egendata.se`
iat | Unix timestamp for when the message was created.
